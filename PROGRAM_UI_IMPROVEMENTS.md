# Program and Session UI Improvements

## Overview
Fixed overlap issues and improved navigation in the program and session management interface. The changes ensure proper z-index hierarchy, better layout structure, and enhanced mobile responsiveness.

## Changes Made

### 1. Z-Index Hierarchy Standardization
**Problem:** Inconsistent z-index values causing modal overlap issues
- SessionModal: Used invalid `z-60` instead of `z-[60]`
- SessionBuilder: Used `z-[100]`
- ProgramAddExerciseOptions: Used `z-[110]`

**Solution:** Established consistent z-index scale:
- Base modals: `z-[60]`
- Nested modals: `z-[70]`
- SessionBuilder: `z-[80]` (full-screen modal)
- ProgramAddExerciseOptions: `z-[110]` (exercise selection overlay)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/programs/SessionModal.tsx`
- `src/features/programs/SessionBuilder.tsx`

### 2. Layout Structure Improvements

#### ProgramDetail.tsx
**Problem:** 
- Main content was improperly nested inside header
- Sticky header causing layout issues
- Poor mobile responsiveness

**Solution:**
- Restructured component with proper flex layout
- Added breadcrumb navigation for better context
- Separated header from main content area
- Added proper z-index to sticky header (`z-20`)
- Improved responsive spacing with `sm:` breakpoints
- Added `max-w-4xl` to content for better readability on large screens
- Made buttons and text responsive to screen size

**Structure:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col"> // Main container
  <div>Breadcrumb</div>
  <header className="sticky top-0 z-20">...</header>
  <main className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    <div className="max-w-4xl">Content</div>
  </main>
</div>
```

#### ProgramList.tsx
**Problem:** Similar layout issues as ProgramDetail

**Solution:**
- Applied same flex layout pattern
- Added `max-w-7xl` container for grid layout
- Proper sticky header with z-index
- Improved scroll behavior

#### SessionBuilder.tsx
**Problem:**
- Full-screen modal but scroll behavior unclear
- No breadcrumb context

**Solution:**
- Added breadcrumb showing navigation path
- Ensured proper flex layout with scrollable main content
- Added `max-w-4xl` for better form layout
- Header stays fixed at top with proper z-index

### 3. Navigation Improvements

**Added Breadcrumbs:**
- ProgramDetail: `Programs > [Program Name]`
- SessionBuilder: `Programs > Program > New/Edit Session`

**Benefits:**
- Clear hierarchy indication
- Quick back navigation
- Better user orientation
- Consistent navigation pattern

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness

**Improvements:**
- Responsive padding: `p-3 sm:p-4`
- Responsive text sizes: `text-lg sm:text-xl`
- Responsive icon sizes: `w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5`
- Responsive gaps: `gap-1 sm:gap-2`
- Text wrapping with `break-words` and `line-clamp-2`
- Flexible button groups with `flex-wrap`

### 5. Accessibility Improvements

**Added:**
- `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons
- Descriptive titles for hover tooltips
- Better focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

## Visual Improvements

### Layout
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Better visual hierarchy
- Improved content readability with max-width constraints
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Colors & Borders
- Consistent border colors: `border-white/10`
- Subtle backgrounds: `bg-[#1a1a1a]`, `bg-[#0f0f0f]`
- Activity type badges with proper contrast
- Clear visual separation between sections

### Scrolling
- Proper overflow handling
- Smooth scroll behavior with `overscroll-contain`
- Fixed headers don't interfere with content
- No content hidden behind sticky elements

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Flow:**
   - Programs list → Program detail → Session builder
   - Back navigation at each level
   - Breadcrumb clicks

2. **Responsive Testing:**
   - Mobile (320px - 640px)
   - Tablet (640px - 1024px)
   - Desktop (1024px+)

3. **Modal Behavior:**
   - Open multiple modals (ensure z-index works)
   - Close modals with back button
   - Modal backdrop clicks

4. **Scroll Testing:**
   - Long session lists
   - Many exercises in session
   - Ensure headers stay visible

## Browser Compatibility

All changes use standard CSS and React patterns compatible with:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (iOS 12+)
- Mobile browsers

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: Only CSS and structural changes
- No new dependencies
- Improved rendering with proper flex layout
- Better scroll performance with `overscroll-contain`

## Future Enhancements

Consider:
1. Add swipe gestures for mobile navigation
2. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
3. Drag-and-drop session reordering
4. Search/filter in long program lists
5. Quick actions menu on long-press (mobile)

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to data structures
- Component APIs unchanged
- Follows existing design system patterns
