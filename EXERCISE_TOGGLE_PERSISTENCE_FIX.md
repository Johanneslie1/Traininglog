# Exercise Toggle Visibility Persistence Fix

## Problem
The exercise toggle hide/show functionality was resetting after:
1. Page refresh/reload
2. Adding new exercises 
3. Any component re-render

This happened because the visibility state was only stored in component state (`useState`) without any persistence mechanism.

## Solution
Implemented persistent storage for exercise visibility state using localStorage with the following improvements:

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/utils/hiddenExercisesStorage.ts` (New File)
- Created utility functions for managing hidden exercises in localStorage
- Functions include:
  - `loadHiddenExercises()`: Load from localStorage with error handling
  - `saveHiddenExercises()`: Save to localStorage with error handling  
  - `toggleExerciseVisibility()`: Toggle and persist visibility state
  - `cleanupHiddenExercises()`: Clean up stale exercise IDs

#### 2. `src/components/DraggableExerciseDisplay.tsx`
- **Before**: Used local state `useState<Set<string>>(new Set())` 
- **After**: Initialize state from localStorage using `loadHiddenExercises()`
- Updated toggle function to use utility functions
- Added cleanup effect to remove stale exercise IDs from storage

### Key Features

1. **Persistence**: Hidden/visible state survives page reloads
2. **Performance**: Efficient localStorage operations with error handling
3. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes stale exercise IDs when exercises are deleted
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if localStorage fails

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Component loads hidden state from localStorage on mount
2. **Toggle**: When user clicks hide/show button:
   - State is updated in React
   - Change is immediately saved to localStorage
3. **Cleanup**: When exercises list changes:
   - Check for deleted exercises in hidden state
   - Remove stale IDs from both state and localStorage
4. **Persistence**: Hidden state persists across:
   - Page reloads
   - Browser restarts
   - Adding/removing other exercises

### Storage Key
- Uses localStorage key: `'hiddenExercises'`
- Stores array of exercise IDs as JSON string
- Automatically converts to/from Set for efficient operations

### Backward Compatibility
- Gracefully handles missing or corrupted localStorage data
- Falls back to empty state if localStorage unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing component API

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Toggle state persists after page reload  
- ✅ Toggle state persists when adding new exercises
- ✅ Cleanup works when exercises are deleted
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Graceful error handling for localStorage failures

## Usage
The functionality is automatic - users can now:
1. Hide exercise details by clicking the toggle button
2. Refresh the page and see the same exercises still hidden
3. Add new exercises without affecting existing visibility states
4. Have their preferences remembered across browser sessions
