# Multi-Activity Exercise Tracking System - Complete Implementation

## üéØ **System Overview**

The multi-activity exercise tracking system replaces the single-category logging approach with a comprehensive, category-specific system that supports:

- **Resistance Training** - Weight lifting, strength training with sets, reps, weight, RPE
- **Sports Activities** - Team sports, individual competitions with scores, performance metrics
- **Stretching & Flexibility** - Static/dynamic stretches, yoga with duration, intensity, flexibility tracking
- **Endurance Training** - Running, cycling, swimming with distance, pace, heart rate metrics
- **Other Activities** - Custom activities with configurable fields (meditation, therapy, etc.)

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Type System** (`src/types/activityTypes.ts`)
   - `ActivityType` enum for all activity categories
   - Specific interfaces for each activity type (ResistanceExercise, SportActivity, etc.)
   - Logging interfaces for each category with type-specific data structures
   - Union types for flexible handling

2. **Database Layer** (`src/data/activityDatabase.ts`)
   - Separate databases for each activity type
   - Pre-configured default activities for each category
   - Helper functions for database queries and filtering

3. **Service Layer** (`src/services/activityService.ts`)
   - `ActivityService` - CRUD operations for activities
   - `ActivityLoggingService` - Type-specific logging with proper data validation
   - Unified interface for all activity types

4. **Export System** (`src/services/activityExportService.ts`)
   - Category-specific CSV export formats
   - JSON export with metadata
   - Statistical analysis and reporting
   - Flexible filtering and date range selection

### **UI Components**

1. **Multi-Activity Logger** (`src/components/activities/MultiActivityLogger.tsx`)
   - Main entry point with activity type selection
   - Beautiful card-based interface for each activity type
   - Routing to specific activity loggers

2. **Activity-Specific Pickers**
   - `ResistanceActivityPicker.tsx` - Strength training with sets/reps/weight
   - `SportActivityPicker.tsx` - Sports with sessions, skills, opponents
   - `StretchingActivityPicker.tsx` - Flexibility with duration/intensity
   - `EnduranceActivityPicker.tsx` - Cardio with distance/pace/heart rate
   - `OtherActivityPicker.tsx` - Custom activities with dynamic fields

## üìä **Data Structures**

```typescript
enum ActivityType {
  RESISTANCE = 'resistance',
  SPORT = 'sport',

- **Metrics**: Flexibility improvements, session consistency
- **Export**: Duration summaries with flexibility progress

### **Endurance Training**
- **Fields**: Distance, duration, pace, heart rate zones, calories, elevation
- **Metrics**: Pace analysis, heart rate trends, endurance progression
- **Export**: Distance/time summaries with performance metrics

### **Other Activities**
- **Fields**: Fully customizable with field types (number, string, select, boolean, duration)
- **Metrics**: Custom field analytics
- **Export**: Dynamic field export based on activity configuration

## üöÄ **Key Features**

### **1. Unified Logging Interface**
- Single "Add Exercise" button with activity type selection
- Consistent UI patterns across all activity types
- Seamless navigation between different logging modes

### **2. Type-Specific Databases**
- Curated exercise databases for each activity type
- Category filtering (compound, isolation, team sports, etc.)
- Search functionality across all databases

### **3. Smart Data Validation**
- Activity-type specific validation rules
- Required vs optional fields based on activity type
- Metric tracking only for relevant fields

### **4. Advanced Export System**
- CSV exports with activity-specific columns
- JSON exports with full metadata
- Statistical reports across all activity types
- Date range filtering and activity type filtering

### **5. Backward Compatibility**
- Existing resistance training logs remain functional
- Gradual migration path for users
- Legacy data integration with new system
