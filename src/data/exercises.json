    "name": "30 Hanging Toes-To-Bar",
    "description": "The hanging toes-to-bar is an advanced abdominal exercise in which the lifter touches their feet to a pull-up bar. There are many ways to perform this movement: strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent, each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps.",

In between reps, you perform a crunch. It is commonly performed for reps or time in bodyweight circuits and animal-style flows, but can also work on its own or as part of a dynamic warm-up or mobility sequence.",

The linear jammer involves pressing the weight into the air, then catching it with the other hand. The movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges, for lower reps with a focus on explosive pressing power, or for higher reps.",

    "description": "The step-up with knee raise is a lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.",

Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.",

However, some people find that SMR on the lower back can aggravate existing pain or injury, so be cautious when performing it.",

    "description": "The standing lat pull-down is a variation of the lat pull-down performed standing next to a cable stack rather than sitting on a bench or machine. It has all of the same benefits of a lat pull-down performed on a bench or machine, in addition to providing further activation to the core and lower body. If you are too tall to perform this movement, a kneeling lat pull-down provides all of the same benefits.",

If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.",

It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.",

Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.",

If no sled is available, other viable options include dragging chain, a barbell plate, or a tire. The bear crawl sled drag is an intense full-body movement that targets the cardiovascular system as well as a wide range of muscle groups, particularly the shoulders, core, and legs. It can be done in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning.",

It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The landmine squat is similar in many ways to a goblet squat, but with slight differences due to the angle of the barbell. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges or for higher reps.",

It differs from the clean and press in that the push-press allows you to use lower-body momentum to power through the most difficult part of the press. It can be trained in low to moderate reps for strength, or for higher reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, for muscle building or metabolic conditioning.",

    "description": "The dumbbell row to triceps kick-back is a dumbbell complex that combines two movements that collectively target the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), upper back, and triceps. It also isometrically targets the core, hamstrings, and glutes. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.",
