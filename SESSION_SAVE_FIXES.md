# Session Save Fixes - Firestore Undefined Values & Performance

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Firestore Error - Undefined Values
**Error**: `FirebaseError: Function WriteBatch.set() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined`

**Root Cause**: When saving sessions to programs, undefined values were being passed to Firestore. Firestore does not allow `undefined` as a field value.

**Solution**: 
1. Applied `removeUndefinedFields()` to sessionData before saving
2. Updated exercise processing to only add fields when they have values
3. Added `notes` field to session type definition

**Changes Made**:
- `src/services/programService.ts`:
  - Wrapped sessionData with `removeUndefinedFields()` in `createSession()`
  - Modified exercise processing to conditionally add `exerciseRef` and `activityType`
  - Added `notes` field to session parameter type

```typescript
// Before (bad - passes undefined):
const exerciseData = {
  id: exerciseId,
  name: exercise.name,
  exerciseRef: exercise.exerciseRef || undefined,
  activityType: exercise.activityType || undefined
};

// After (good - only defined values):
const exerciseData: any = {
  id: exerciseId,
  name: exercise.name,
  notes: exercise.notes || '',
  order: exercise.order ?? 0
};

if (exercise.exerciseRef) {
  exerciseData.exerciseRef = exercise.exerciseRef;
}

if (exercise.activityType) {
  exerciseData.activityType = exercise.activityType;
}
```

### Issue 2: TypeError in UniversalExercisePicker
**Error**: `TypeError: (e.equipment || []).forEach is not a function`

**Root Cause**: In `sportFilters.ts`, the code assumed `equipment` and `primarySkills` were always arrays, but sometimes they could be strings or undefined.

**Solution**: Added proper type checking and normalization to ensure these fields are always arrays before calling `.forEach()`.

**Changes Made**:
- `src/utils/sportFilters.ts`:
  - Added array normalization in `enrich()` function
  - Added array checks in `collectFacets()` function

```typescript
// Before (assumes array):
(e.equipment||[]).forEach((eq:string)=>facets.equipment.add(eq));

// After (ensures array):
const equipment = Array.isArray(e.equipment) 
  ? e.equipment 
  : (e.equipment ? [e.equipment] : []);
equipment.forEach((eq:string)=>facets.equipment.add(eq));
```

### Issue 3: Excessive State Persistence Calls
**Problem**: Form data was being saved to localStorage hundreds of times per second, causing performance issues.

**Root Cause**: The `usePersistedFormState` hook saved to localStorage on every state change without any debouncing, triggering hundreds of writes during rapid user interactions.

**Solution**: Added 500ms debouncing to the state persistence logic.

**Changes Made**:
- `src/hooks/usePersistedState.ts`:
  - Added debounce timer using `useRef`
  - State changes now wait 500ms before saving
  - Previous timer is cleared on each new change
  - Timer is cleaned up on unmount

```typescript
// Before (immediate save):
useEffect(() => {
  StatePersistence.saveFormData(formId, value);
}, [value, formId]);

// After (debounced save):
const saveTimerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (saveTimerRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(saveTimerRef.current);
  }

  saveTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    StatePersistence.saveFormData(formId, value);
  }, 500);

  return () => {
    if (saveTimerRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(saveTimerRef.current);
    }
  };
}, [value, formId]);
```

## Benefits

✅ **Sessions Save Successfully**: No more Firestore undefined value errors
✅ **No More Sport Activity Errors**: Equipment and skills handled properly
✅ **Better Performance**: 
  - Reduced localStorage writes from hundreds to just a few per form interaction
  - Smoother UI during rapid state changes
  - Better battery life on mobile devices

## Testing

### Test Session Creation
1. Open a program
2. Create or edit a session
3. Add exercises using "Copy from Previous"
4. Save the session
5. **Expected**: Session saves without Firestore errors
6. Check browser console - should see:
   - `[programService] Session created successfully`
   - NO `FirebaseError` messages

### Test Sport Activity Selection
1. Create a new session
2. Click "Add Exercise"
3. Select "Sports" activity type
4. **Expected**: No console errors about equipment.forEach
5. Sports should display with proper filtering

### Test State Persistence
1. Open SessionBuilder
2. Type session name rapidly
3. Add multiple exercises quickly
4. Check browser console
5. **Expected**: 
   - Form saves occur less frequently (every 500ms max)
   - NO spam of `[StatePersistence] Form data saved` messages
   - Final state is still preserved correctly

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/programService.ts`
   - Added `removeUndefinedFields()` to session creation
   - Modified exercise data processing
   - Updated session type to include notes

2. `src/utils/sportFilters.ts`
   - Added array normalization for equipment and skills
   - Added proper type checking before forEach calls

3. `src/hooks/usePersistedState.ts`
   - Added 500ms debounce to state persistence
   - Added cleanup for timer on unmount
