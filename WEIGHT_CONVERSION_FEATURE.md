# Weight Unit Conversion Feature

## Overview
The app now automatically converts all weight values when switching between kg and lb units in the settings. This ensures that the physical weight represented by the numbers remains the same regardless of the unit system.

## How It Works

### Automatic Data Conversion
When you change the unit setting from kg to lb (or vice versa), the app automatically:

1. **Converts Exercise Logs**: All previously logged exercise sets have their weight values converted
2. **Converts Templates**: Saved workout templates have their weight values converted  
3. **Updates Display**: All weight displays throughout the app immediately show the new units
4. **Adjusts Increments**: Weight increment values are automatically adjusted for the new unit system

### Conversion Examples
- **100kg** becomes **220.5lb**
- **220lb** becomes **99.8kg**
- **2.5kg** becomes **5.5lb**
- **5lb** becomes **2.3kg**
- **45kg** becomes **99.2lb**

### Conversion Formula
- **kg to lb**: weight Ã— 2.20462 (rounded to 1 decimal place)
- **lb to kg**: weight Ã· 2.20462 (rounded to 1 decimal place)

## What Gets Converted

### Exercise Data
- âœ… All exercise sets in exercise logs
- âœ… Historical workout data
- âœ… Current session weights

### Program & Template Data  
- âœ… Workout templates saved locally
- âœ… Program exercise weights (when stored locally)
- âœ… Session builder data

### Settings
- âœ… Weight increment values (2.5kg â†” 5lb, 5kg â†” 10lb)
- âœ… Input step values in weight editors
- âœ… Placeholder text showing correct units

## User Experience

### Before the Feature
- Switching from kg to lb would keep the same numbers (100kg would still show as 100lb)
- Users had to manually recalculate all their weights
- Workout history became inconsistent

### After the Feature  
- Switching from kg to lb automatically converts values (100kg becomes 220.5lb)
- All historical data maintains correct physical weight representation
- Seamless unit switching with no data loss

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- `weightConversion.ts` - Core conversion functions
- `exerciseConversion.ts` - Exercise data conversion utilities  
- `SettingsContext.tsx` - Automatic conversion trigger
- `localStorageUtils.ts` - Bulk data update functions

### Conversion Flow
1. User changes unit setting in Settings modal
2. SettingsContext detects unit change
3. System loads all exercise logs from localStorage
4. System loads all templates from localStorage
5. Conversion utilities transform all weight values
6. Updated data is saved back to storage
7. UI immediately reflects new units and values

### Data Safety
- âœ… **Conversion is reversible** - Converting kgâ†’lbâ†’kg returns to original values
- âœ… **Precision handling** - Values are rounded to 1 decimal place to avoid floating point errors
- âœ… **Error handling** - Conversion failures are logged but don't break the app
- âœ… **Atomic updates** - All data is converted in a single operation

## Console Logging
The conversion process provides detailed console output for debugging:

```
ðŸ”„ Converting 15 exercise logs from kg to lb
âœ… Successfully converted all exercise weights from kg to lb
ðŸ”„ Converting 3 templates from kg to lb  
âœ… Successfully converted all template weights from kg to lb
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Firebase Data**: When Firebase programs contain weight data, they could also be converted
- **Bulk Import**: CSV import/export could include unit conversion
- **User Confirmation**: Optional confirmation dialog before converting large amounts of data
- **Conversion History**: Track when conversions were performed

## Benefits
1. **Seamless Experience**: No manual recalculation needed when switching units
2. **Data Integrity**: Historical workout data maintains physical accuracy
3. **Global Consistency**: Every weight value in the app uses the selected unit system
4. **Automatic Increments**: Weight increment settings automatically adjust for the unit system

This feature makes the app truly international and user-friendly for users who prefer different unit systems or need to switch between them.
