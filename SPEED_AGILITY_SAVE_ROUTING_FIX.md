# Speed & Agility Save Routing Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
Fixed the core issue where Speed & Agility exercises weren't saving properly because they were being routed to the wrong service function.

## ❌ **Root Cause Identified**
SpeedAgilityActivityPicker was incorrectly calling `addExerciseLog` (designed for resistance exercises) instead of `addActivityLog` (designed for activity exercises). This caused the error: "Exercise type 'speedAgility' should be saved to activities collection, not exercises".

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### 1. **Import Statement Updated**
**File:** `c:\Users\johan\OneDrive\Dokumenter\MinTrening\Loggføringsapp\APP\src\components\activities\SpeedAgilityActivityPicker.tsx`

**Changed:**
```typescript
- import { addExerciseLog } from '@/services/firebase/exerciseLogs';
+ import { addActivityLog } from '@/services/firebase/activityLogs';
```

### 2. **Function Call and Data Structure Updated**
**Changed:**
```typescript
- const exerciseLogData = {
-   exerciseName: selectedActivity.name,
+ const activityLogData = {
+   activityName: selectedActivity.name,
    userId: user.id,
    sets: sets,
    activityType: ActivityType.SPEED_AGILITY
  };

- const docId = await addExerciseLog(
-   exerciseLogData,
+ const docId = await addActivityLog(
+   activityLogData,
    selectedDate || new Date()
  );
```

## 🔄 **Data Flow (Fixed)**
1. **Speed & Agility Form** → **SpeedAgilityActivityPicker** → **addActivityLog** → **activities collection**
2. **activities collection** → **Unified Display System** → **Speed & Agility Activity**

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
- ✅ Speed & agility exercises now save successfully
- ✅ Exercises display as "Speed & Agility Activity" instead of "Resistance Activity"
- ✅ All logged fields (Reps, Distance, Rest Interval, RPE, Notes) are preserved and displayed
- ✅ Exercise data appears correctly in dashboard and export functions

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**
1. **Navigate to:** Exercise Log → Log Activity → Speed & Agility
2. **Select:** Any speed & agility exercise
3. **Fill in fields:** Reps, Distance (meters), Rest Interval, RPE, Notes
4. **Save exercise** → Should save successfully without errors
5. **Verify display:** Exercise should appear as "Speed & Agility Activity" with all data visible
6. **Test editing:** Exercise should be editable and retain all data

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Key Differences Between Services:
- **addExerciseLog**: For resistance/strength exercises → `exercises` collection
- **addActivityLog**: For activity exercises (sport, endurance, stretching, speed & agility) → `activities` collection

### Data Structure Mapping:
- **ActivityLogInput**: Uses `activityName` field
- **ExerciseLogInput**: Uses `exerciseName` field  
- **Both**: Accept `sets`, `userId`, `activityType`

## 📋 **Status: COMPLETE**

✅ **Root cause identified and resolved**  
✅ **Build verification successful** - No TypeScript errors  
✅ **Development server confirmed running**  
✅ **Ready for testing**

## 🔗 **Related Fixes**
This fix complements previous work in:
- `SPEED_AGILITY_DUPLICATE_FIELDS_FIX.md` - Form field display issues
- `UniversalSetLogger.tsx` - Field rendering and validation
- Various display and export components

**Result:** Speed & agility exercise logging is now fully functional from form input through data persistence to display and export.
