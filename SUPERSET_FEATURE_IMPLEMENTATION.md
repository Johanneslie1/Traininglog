   - Superset button integrated into exercise action menu
   - Clean, space-efficient superset display
   - Visual connection lines between superset exercises
   - Exercise numbering with intuitive hierarchy (1, 2, 3 for individual exercises; 4a, 4b for superset groups)
   - SupersetActionsButton for renaming and breaking supersets

4. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: ✅
   - Smooth drag-and-drop reordering of both individual exercises and superset groups
   - Visual feedback during dragging (scale effect, shadows)
   - Drag handles for intuitive interaction
   - Automatic exercise numbering updates after reordering

5. **Data Model Updates**: ✅
   - Simplified SupersetGroup interface (removed rest timer properties)
   - Proper superset-exercise relationship tracking
   - Backward compatibility maintained
   - Added exercise order persistence

### File Changes Made:

#### Context & Data Management:
- `src/context/SupersetContext.tsx`: 
  - Added date-based persistence methods
  - Removed rest timer properties from superset creation
  - Auto-save functionality when supersets change
  - Added exercise order tracking and persistence
  - Added `renameSuperset` function for superset management

#### Components:
- `src/components/ExerciseCard.tsx`:
  - Added superset button to exercise action menu
  - Improved superset state visual feedback
  - Proper integration with superset creation workflow
  - Added exercise numbering with sub-number support for supersets
  - Enhanced visual display with compact set representation

- `src/components/SupersetControls.tsx`:
  - Removed rest timer display from superset info
  - Cleaner superset management interface

- `src/components/DraggableExerciseDisplay.tsx` (New!):
  - Implemented using react-beautiful-dnd
  - Handles both individual exercises and superset groups
  - Visual enhancements for drag interactions
  - Automatic exercise numbering updates
  - Smooth, intuitive drag experience
  - Integrated SupersetActionsButton for superset management

- `src/components/FloatingSupersetControls.tsx` (New!):
  - Floating UI for superset creation workflow
  - Improved user experience with real-time feedback
  - Simple, intuitive interface for creating supersets

- `src/components/SupersetNameModal.tsx` (New!):
  - Modal dialog for naming supersets
  - Focus trapping and keyboard navigation
  - Clean, minimal interface

- `src/components/SupersetActionsButton.tsx` (New!):
  - Dropdown menu for managing existing supersets
  - Rename functionality with inline editing
  - Break superset option
  - Accessible interface with keyboard support

- `src/components/SupersetWorkoutDisplay.tsx`:
  - Replaced with DraggableExerciseDisplay
  - Removed all rest timer UI elements
  - Simplified superset display layout
  - Focused on exercise connections only

#### Services:
- `src/features/exercises/ExerciseLog.tsx`:
  - Integrated superset loading with date changes
  - Proper superset context initialization
  - Added exercise reordering with persistence
  - Updated to use new DraggableExerciseDisplay component

- `src/types/session.ts`:
  - Updated SupersetGroup interface to remove rest timer properties
  - Cleaner, more focused data model

### Technical Implementation:

#### Persistence Strategy:
- **Superset Storage Key**: `superset_data_YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **Exercise Order Key**: `exercise_order_YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **Auto-save**: Changes automatically saved to localStorage
- **Auto-load**: Data loaded when date changes
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of missing/corrupted data

#### Drag-and-Drop Implementation:
- **Library**: react-beautiful-dnd for smooth, accessible drag operations
- **Grouping**: Preserves superset groups during drag operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Scale, shadow, and movement effects during dragging
- **Persistence**: Exercise order saved to localStorage after reordering
- **Numbering**: Automatic update of exercise numbers after reordering

#### Button Placement:
- Superset button appears in exercise action menu
- Visual state: Purple highlight when exercise is in superset
- Conditional display: Creation mode vs normal mode

#### Data Flow:
1. User selects date → Load supersets and exercise order for that date
2. User creates superset → Save immediately to localStorage
3. User reorders exercises → Update order in state and localStorage
4. User navigates away → All changes persist automatically
5. User returns → All data loads automatically with preserved order

### User Experience:
- **Intuitive**: Superset creation integrated into existing exercise workflow
- **Persistent**: All changes save automatically and restore on return
- **Visual**: Clear indicators show superset relationships
- **Clean**: Removed clutter (rest timers) for focused experience
- **Interactive**: Smooth drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback
- **Organized**: Automatic exercise numbering with hierarchical structure

### Next Steps:
- Monitor user feedback for any additional superset features
- Consider adding superset templates for common exercise combinations
- Potential future: Cloud sync for superset data across devices
- User customization of superset appearance (colors, styles)

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING
All changes compile successfully and maintain existing functionality.

   - Simplified superset data model

4. **Added Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
   - Smooth, intuitive exercise reordering
   - Persistent exercise order
   - Visual feedback during drag operations
   - Automatic exercise numbering updates

5. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Visual feedback for superset membership
   - Clean, professional interface
   - Proper state management across sessions
