### 8. Migration Tools
- **Created**: `scripts/migrateExerciseTypes.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automated migration from legacy to new exercise types
  - Intelligent category assignment
  - Validation and reporting
  - Batch processing capabilities

## ðŸ“Š Exercise Type Specifications

- **Optional**: HR Zone 1, 2, 3 time, notes
- **Use Case**: Cardiovascular training (removed pace as requested)

### Team Sports
- **Required**: Duration, distance, RPE
- **Optional**: HR Zone 1, 2, 3 time, notes
- **Use Case**: Sports activities (removed position/goals as requested)

### Flexibility
- **Required**: Duration, stretch type, intensity
- **Optional**: Notes
- **Use Case**: Stretching and mobility work

### Other Activities
- **Required**: Duration, RPE
- **Optional**: Distance, HR Zone 1, 2, 3 time, notes
- **Use Case**: Hiking, individual sports, general activities
