# Session Persistence Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Sessions were not being persisted to Firestore when created through the UI. The problem was in `ProgramDetail.tsx` where:

1. **Edit existing session** - ✅ Was working correctly (called `updateSession()`)
2. **Create new session** - ❌ Only updated local state, never persisted to Firestore
3. **Delete session** - ❌ Only updated local state, never deleted from Firestore

## Root Cause
The `handleSessionSave` function in `ProgramDetail.tsx` had two different flows:
- For editing: properly called `updateSession()` service to persist to Firestore
- For creating: only called `onUpdate()` to update local React state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `createSession()` function in `programService.ts`
- Handles creation of new sessions in Firestore
- Validates program ownership
- Processes exercise data correctly
- Returns the new Firestore-generated session ID
- Uses batch writes for data consistency

### 2. Created `deleteSession()` function in `programService.ts`
- Handles deletion of sessions from Firestore
- Validates program and session ownership
- Uses batch writes to update program timestamp

### 3. Updated `ProgramDetail.tsx`
- Import and use `createSession()` for new sessions
- Import and use `deleteSession()` for session deletion
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper error handling with user feedback

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/programService.ts`**
   - Added `createSession()` function
   - Added `deleteSession()` function

2. **`src/features/programs/ProgramDetail.tsx`**
   - Updated imports to include new service functions
   - Modified `handleSessionSave()` to use `createSession()` for new sessions
   - Modified `handleDeleteSession()` to use `deleteSession()` for deletion
   - Added detailed console logging for debugging

## Firestore Operations Now Working

### Session Creation Flow:
1. User fills out SessionModal and clicks Save
2. `handleSessionSave()` calls `createSession()` service
3. `createSession()` validates program ownership
4. Session data is persisted to Firestore collection `/programs/{programId}/sessions/{sessionId}`
5. Local React state is updated with the Firestore-generated session ID
6. UI reflects the new session

### Session Update Flow:
1. User edits existing session and clicks Save
2. `handleSessionSave()` calls `updateSession()` service (already working)
3. Session exercises are updated in Firestore
4. Local React state is updated

### Session Deletion Flow:
1. User clicks delete and confirms
2. `handleDeleteSession()` calls `deleteSession()` service
3. Session is deleted from Firestore
4. Local React state is updated

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test - Create Session:
1. Navigate to a program detail page
2. Click "Add Session"
3. Enter session name and add exercises
4. Click Save
5. **Expected**: Session appears in UI
6. **Verify**: Refresh page - session should still be there (persisted)
7. **Check console**: Should see logs starting with `[ProgramDetail]` and `[programService]`

### Manual Test - Edit Session:
1. Click edit button on existing session
2. Modify session name or exercises
3. Click Save
4. **Expected**: Changes reflected in UI
5. **Verify**: Refresh page - changes should persist

### Manual Test - Delete Session:
1. Click delete button on existing session
2. Confirm deletion
3. **Expected**: Session removed from UI
4. **Verify**: Refresh page - session should not reappear

### Database Verification:
- Check Firestore console at `programs/{programId}/sessions/`
- Sessions should be visible with correct data structure
- Timestamps should be properly set

## Error Handling
- All service functions include proper error handling
- User-friendly error messages are displayed
- Console logs provide debugging information
- Firestore rules are properly configured for session CRUD operations

## Performance Considerations
- Uses batch writes to ensure data consistency
- Minimal Firestore operations (no unnecessary reads)
- Local state updates happen after successful Firestore operations
- Proper loading states during async operations
