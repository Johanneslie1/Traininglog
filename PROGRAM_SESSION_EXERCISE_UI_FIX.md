# Program Session Exercise Addition - UI Cleanup & Bug Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Removed Unnecessary Options from Program Session Exercise Addition
**Problem**: When adding exercises to sessions within programs, users saw "From History" and "Exercise Database" options that weren't needed for this context.

**Solution**: Removed these options from the helper categories in `ProgramAddExerciseOptions.tsx`.

**Changed**:
- Before: 4 quick add options (Add from Program, Copy from Previous, From History, Exercise Database)
- After: 2 quick add options (Add from Program, Copy from Previous)

**Rationale**: 
- "From History" and "Exercise Database" are more relevant for daily workout logging
- For program creation, users typically want to:
  1. Copy exercises from existing programs
  2. Copy exercises from previous workouts
  3. Select exercises by activity type (Resistance, Sport, Stretching, etc.)

### Issue 2: "Copy from Previous Day" Showing No Results in Program Sessions
**Problem**: When trying to copy exercises from previous days to a session within a program, no results were displayed. However, it worked correctly in the exercise log.

**Root Cause**: The `userId` prop was being passed as an empty string (`userId=""`) in `SessionBuilder.tsx`, causing the query to fail.

**Solution**: Modified `SessionBuilder.tsx` to fetch the current user's ID from Firebase Auth and pass it correctly to `CopyFromPreviousSessionDialog`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/features/programs/ProgramAddExerciseOptions.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Removed "From History" and "Exercise Database" from `helperCategories` array
- Updated onClick handler to only handle "programs" and "copyPrevious"
- Added underscore prefix to unused props (`_onOpenHistory`, `_onOpenDatabase`) to satisfy TypeScript

```typescript
// Before:
const helperCategories: Category[] = [
  { id: 'programs', name: 'Add from Program', ... },
  { id: 'copyPrevious', name: 'Copy from Previous', ... },
  { id: 'history', name: 'From History', ... },
  { id: 'database', name: 'Exercise Database', ... }
];

// After:
const helperCategories: Category[] = [
  { id: 'programs', name: 'Add from Program', ... },
  { id: 'copyPrevious', name: 'Copy from Previous', ... }
  // Removed: 'From History' and 'Exercise Database'
];
```

### 2. `src/features/programs/SessionBuilder.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Fixed the `copyPrevious` view to properly fetch and pass the current user's ID
- Added React hooks at the top level to avoid Rules of Hooks violations
- UserId state is now managed at component level (not conditionally)

```typescript
// Before:
userId=""

// After (at top level of component):
const [userId, setUserId] = useState('');

// Get userId from Firebase auth
useEffect(() => {
  const getUserId = async () => {
    const { auth } = await import('@/services/firebase/config');
    return auth.currentUser?.uid || '';
  };
  getUserId().then(setUserId);
}, []);

// Then pass in conditional render:
userId={userId}
```

**Important**: Hooks must always be called at the top level of the component to comply with React's Rules of Hooks.

## How It Works Now

### Adding Exercises to Program Sessions
When users click "Add Exercise" in a program session, they see:

**Quick Add Options** (2 options):
1. 📋 **Add from Program** - Copy exercises from existing programs
2. 📝 **Copy from Previous** - Copy exercises from previous workout sessions

**Choose Activity Type** (6 categories):
1. 🏋️‍♂️ Resistance Training
2. ⚽ Sports
3. 🧘‍♀️ Stretching & Flexibility
4. 🏃‍♂️ Endurance Training
5. ⚡ Speed, Agility & Plyo
6. 🎯 Other Activities

### Copy from Previous Day (Fixed)
- Now properly queries the user's exercise history
- Displays exercises from selected previous dates
- Allows multi-select and batch copy
- Preserves exercise types and data

## Testing

### Test Copy from Previous Day
1. Create or open a program
2. Add or edit a session
3. Click "Add Exercise"
4. Click "📝 Copy from Previous"
5. Select a previous date where you have logged exercises
6. **Expected**: Exercises from that date should appear
7. Select exercises and confirm
8. **Expected**: Exercises should be added to the session

### Test UI Cleanup
1. Open program builder
2. Add or edit a session
3. Click "Add Exercise"
4. **Expected**: Only "Add from Program" and "Copy from Previous" should appear in Quick Add
5. **Expected**: "From History" and "Exercise Database" options are removed
6. Activity type options should still be available below

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant options that cluttered the interface
✅ **Fixed Functionality**: Copy from Previous Day now works correctly in program sessions
✅ **Better UX**: Users can now properly populate program sessions from their workout history
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Copy from Previous works the same in both exercise log and program sessions

## Notes

- The "From History" and "Exercise Database" pickers are still available through the activity type selection
- Users can still access all exercises by selecting the appropriate activity type
- The removed options were redundant since exercises can be added through activity type categories
- This streamlines the program creation workflow
